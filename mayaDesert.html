      <h2>Desert Graphics</h2>
      <p id="text">
        Silicon Canyon, analogous to Silicon Valley, is a junk-littered
        dystopian desert in which environmental destruction and planned
        obsolescence have occurred. Visuals of deserts are a central theme in
        Nowheres and Silicon Canyon. Kanarek worked with a colleague to gather
        user tracking data and superimposed the data over a Nowhere image
        sporadically. 3D desert landscapes with users’ tracking data were
        hand-drawn on top of them. In the thread of a boundless internet
        structure, Kamarek filtered the data using various parameters, such as
        the first minute of every day over a certain period. The artist takes a
        similar approach in creating the images of deserts find in the World of
        Awe. The concept was ignited by a series of questions about where her
        electronic garbage was going. Playing with the idea of the final
        destination of her old computers, the artists visualized a technological
        dystopia of mountains of digital debris collecting over time.
