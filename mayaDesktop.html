        A vintage desktop layout emerges when the viewer opens the World of Awe.
        To enter the story, the viewer must click the application icons on the
        screen and links on the bookmark bar. Kanarek views applications as a
        private environment to execute ideas. Because an application harbors a
        solitary experience, she used it in her work as it was appropriate for a
        journal containing the particular narrative she created. Additionally,
        the desktop encourages user intractability and complements the
        story--especially in Silicon Canyon, where the traveler is building a
        laptop from old hardware and software. The desktop interface becomes
        part of the traveler's world; what the viewer sees on the website is the
        content restored from the laptop (T. Whid)Â
